   ## Success rate of converting first downs at converting 1st downs ##
      # True or False - was a first down converted #
        # If FirstDown == 1 and posteam row1 == posteam row2:
            return True
          else:
            return False
            
          # Graph count Trues for each down with ydstogo #
          
   ## Scoring percentage based on field location ##
      # Search for TOUCHDOWN and 'field goal is GOOD' in column #
        while Drive row2 == Drive row1:
          if 'TOUCHDOWN is in desc:
              return 'TOUCHDOWN'
          elif 'field goal is GOOD' is in desc:
              return 'FIELD GOAL'
          else:
              return False
